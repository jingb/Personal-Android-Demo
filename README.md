# Personal-Android-Demo(deprecated)

# latest update
Cause I am focus on java backend development and the [app service api](https://github.com/k3min/infinigag) was no longer available, the app now was deprecated.

# introduction
I am a newbie now and it is just my personal practice demo.
It's an unofficial app client of [9gag](http://9gag.com/). 
Refer to [storm zhang's project](https://github.com/stormzhang/9GAG), and I reimplemented it with different open sources.
